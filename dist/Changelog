Version 0.4.1:
  Bug fixes:
  - Fix incorrect length computation of buffer in t3_win_clrtoeol when the
    current paint position is in the middle of a double-width character. This
    could cause segmentation faults.

Version 0.4.0:
	New features:
	- Add bits to the attribute bits to signify that an attribute has been
	  explicitly set. This allows overriding with an unset value in
	  t3_term_combine_attrs, which was not possible before.

Version 0.3.2:
	Bug fixes:
	- Allow compilation in C++ with pre C++11 compilers.

Version 0.3.1:
	New features:
	- A new function is provided which determines the width of a string with
	  explicit length.
	- Replacement functions for determining the length are provided that return a
	  size_t instead of an int.
	- Includes a C++ class which wraps a t3_window_t pointer and forwards all the
	  functions. Otherwise behaves like std::unique_ptr, to make memory
	  management simpler.

Version 0.3.0:
	New features:
	- Prefer to use Unicode line-drawing characters if they are available. Some
	  terminals explicitly disable the alternate character set if UTF-8 encoding
	  is enabled, resulting in bad output.
	- Don't use the alternate characterset for line drawing if the terminal type
	  is ansi, or if the smacs capability is not defined.
	- Internal tables updated to Unicode 10.0
	- Terminal size detection is done based on cursor position reporting if
	  no other information is available.

	Bug fixes:
	- Conjoining Jamo (Hangul) is now displayed correctly when passed as a
	  single string.
	- Use the correct name of the terminfo entry for the number of columns on
	  the terminal.
	- Use the characters for line drawing provided by the terminfo entry,
	  rather than the vt100 ones.
	- Fix use of destroyed stack variable.

Version 0.2.6:
	Bug fixes:
	- A duplicate symbol was generated by the lack of extern qualifier.

Version 0.2.5:
	- Removes pre-generated Doxygen documentation.
	- Minor updates to Makefile.in for compatibility with Debian packaging.

Version 0.2.4:
	Bug fixes:
	- Fix the returned error on initialization failures. The error was obscured
	  sometimes, leading to the error string "OK" for failed initialization.

Version 0.2.3:
	Re-release of version 0.2.2 to update the configure script.

Version 0.2.2:
	Bug fixes:
	- Return the correct screen width for \0.

Version 0.2.1:
	New features:
	- Add function to retrieve modifiers through terminal specific hacks.

	Miscelaneous changes:
	- Change the internal lookup structure for attributes to a simple hash map.

	Bug fixes:
	- Compile with Large File Support if such support is available on the
	  platform.

Version 0.2.0:
	New features:
	- Support up to 256 colors.
	- Allow setting of options through the T3WINDOW_OPTS environment variable.
	  At this time overriding of the number of colors and pairs, the method of
	  drawing ACS characters (a.k.a. line drawing characters), and disabling
	  ANSI optimization is supported.

	Miscelaneous changes:
	- Deprecated the t3_term_disable_ansi_optimization function. This should be
	  set using the T3WINDOW_OPTS variable instead. To maintain ABI
	  compatability the function is retained as a no-op.

Version 0.1.7:
	Bug fixes:
	- Fix two bugs in the initialisation code which would cause memory leaks
	  when calling t3_term_init more than once (which is a normal use-case when
	  suspending a program).

Version 0.1.6:
	Bug fixes:
	- Using characters with a zero attribute caused incorrect positioning of
	  text placed over the top of it, when the upper text started to the left
	  of the lower text and overlapped with the lower text. This was mainly
	  visible when using the black-and-white mode.

Version 0.1.5:
	New features:
	- Added a function to release all memory allocated internally by
	  libt3window, to aid in debugging.

Version 0.1.4:
	New features:
	- Added a routine to retrieve the visible window at a specific coordinate.

	Miscelaneous changes:
	- Use libunistring instead of libt3unicode.

	Bug fixes:
	- Alternate character set characters are now no longer pushed through the
	  character set conversion routines.
	- Detection of UTF-8 capabilities is improved and more conservative.

Version 0.1.3:
	Miscelaneous changes:
	- Follow libtranscript API change.

Version 0.1.2:
	Bug fixes:
	- Separate input and output file descriptor for stdin/stdout. Using stdout
	  for input caused problems on some systems.

Version 0.1.1:
	Initial release
